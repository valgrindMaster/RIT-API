# RIT-API
<p>This app uses APIs provided by RIT to dynamically showcase information about RIT. You can think about it as a HIGHLY simplified version of RIT's official website. Each tab works with a different API endpoint. The challenge for me was to create a nice UI that would be dynamic. It is not as dynamic as I would like it to be.</p>
